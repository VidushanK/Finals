# Sonar
Live Demo : https://sonarbc.herokuapp.com/

Sonar uses Translink's real-time API to render busses and bus stops within a 150 meter radius. The application detects your location and shows nearby busses in real time.

Sonar is simple and easy to use! Sonar comes with an interactive map with scrolling and zoom.
By clicking on a bus stop, Sonar displays real-time information about en route bus information.
